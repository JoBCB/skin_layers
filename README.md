### Resource materials for Autonomous Practices [P1] — WdKA, Rotterdam 2020

__by Joana Chicau (Practice)__

_Teaching together with the course tutors:_ Dagmar Baumann (Practice); Santiago Pinyol (Theory); jointly with Fabric Station.

__Course Theme: Lapses & Loopholes__

Systems, as institutions and its rules are not "written in stone". They are written by groups or individuals, possibly along with machines, and they can change over time, they can be rewritten, we have the power to change them. This workshop is an invitation to do exactly that, to re-write, to appropriate the rules of the school together with others.

In this transit from information to knowledge it is not only about writing and re-writing, but also enacting and performing such rules. As we know, some of this rules are implicit, and others are explicit — in both cases their effects are real. And in this learning process it is not enough to describe other possible worlds, but it is necessary to bring them closer by embodying them.

We propose for our assignment to take place in the Fabric Station, since rules and regulatons can metaphorically be considered the "fabric", the basic structure, of our institutions. We will speculate with this metaphor, and experiment widely with the material and discover possibilities via station skills such as dyeing and draping.

# Skin Layers

> "In the electric age, we wear all mankind as our skin" [Marshall McLuhan](https://monoskop.org/images/1/1c/De_Kerckhove_Derrick_The_Skin_of_Culture.pdf)
 
> Let ’s imagine the skin of – choreographic  – movement, even without organs and neverthel- ess sensual: as a trace of the body, as a trembling  dividing line between inside and outside – of space  and  body  and  writing  –  and  as  its  interpenetrati- on,  as  a  vibrating  membrane,  as  a  hymen  between   guration  and  de guration  in  the  nowhere  of  the  very  rst step: penetrable for various surfaces, dis- ciplines, arts and media. Imagine how the skin of  movement is folded, unfolded and stroked by gaze  and  breath. [Scores nº0](http://www.annaliska.com/SCORES/SCORES_No_0.pdf)

> "Choreography is the term that presides over a class of ideas: an idea is perhaps in this case a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action. " at [Choreographic Objects by William Forsythe](http://www.williamforsythe.com/essay.html); more quotes from the same author:

> "Choreographies model uncertain outcomes";

> "Choreographies traject ideas into the action of perception";

> "Choreographies may also refuse to act";

> "Choreographies suspend certainty";

> "Choreographies valorize failure";

> "Choreography beyond physical bodies – in between regulation and permeability." [Sandra Noeth, DRAMATURGY – MOBILE OF IDEAS](http://www.annaliska.com/SCORES/SCORES_No_0.pdf)
