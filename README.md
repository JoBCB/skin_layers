### Resource materials for Autonomous Practices [P1] — WdKA, Rotterdam 2020

__by Joana Chicau (Practice)__

_Teaching together with the course tutors:_ Dagmar Baumann (Practice); Santiago Pinyol (Theory); jointly with Fabric Station.

__Course Theme: Lapses & Loopholes__

Systems, as institutions and its rules are not "written in stone". They are written by groups or individuals, possibly along with machines, and they can change over time, they can be rewritten, we have the power to change them. This workshop is an invitation to do exactly that, to re-write, to appropriate the rules of the school together with others.

In this transit from information to knowledge it is not only about writing and re-writing, but also enacting and performing such rules. As we know, some of this rules are implicit, and others are explicit — in both cases their effects are real. And in this learning process it is not enough to describe other possible worlds, but it is necessary to bring them closer by embodying them.

We propose for our assignment to take place in the Fabric Station, since rules and regulatons can metaphorically be considered the "fabric", the basic structure, of our institutions. We will speculate with this metaphor, and experiment widely with the material and discover possibilities via station skills such as dyeing and draping.

# Skin Layers
 
> Let ’s imagine the skin of – choreographic  – movement, even without organs and nevertheless sensual: as a trace of the body, as a trembling  dividing line between inside and outside – of space  and  body  and  writing  –  and  as  its  interpenetrati- on,  as  a  vibrating  membrane,  as  a  hymen  between   guration  and  de guration  in  the  nowhere  of  the  very  rst step: penetrable for various surfaces, disciplines, arts and media. Imagine how the skin of  movement is folded, unfolded and stroked by gaze  and  breath. [Scores nº0](http://www.annaliska.com/SCORES/SCORES_No_0.pdf)

> The study of the history of clothing and textiles traces the development, use, and availability of clothing and textiles over human history. Clothing and textiles reflect the materials and technologies available in different civilizations at different times. The variety and distribution of clothing and textiles within a society reveal social customs and culture. [Continue reading..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_clothing_and_textiles)

> [Anthropometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry)refers to the measurement of the human individual. Today, anthropometry plays an important role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products.

> Facial Weaponization Suite protests against biometric facial recognition–and the inequalities these technologies propagate–by making “collective masks” in workshops that are modeled from the aggregated facial data of participants, resulting in amorphous masks that cannot be detected as human faces by biometric facial recognition technologies. The masks are used for public interventions and performances. One mask, the Fag Face Mask, generated from the biometric facial data of many queer men’s faces, is a response to scientific studies that link determining sexual orientation through rapid facial recognition techniques.

⋅⋅⋅ [BioLogic Second Skin](http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/biologic/) is growing living actuators and synthesizing responsive bio-skin in the era where bio is the new interface. We are imagining a world where actuators and sensors can be grown rather than manufactured, being derived from nature as opposed to engineered in factories.
